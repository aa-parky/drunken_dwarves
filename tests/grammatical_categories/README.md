## Grammatical Categories

The words that describe different parts of speech in a language are called **grammatical categories** or **parts of 
speech**. Each part of speech has its own distinct role and function within a sentence. Here are some common parts of 
speech and their descriptions:

1. **Noun**: A noun is a word that represents a person, place, thing, or idea. Examples: dog, city, happiness.

2. **Verb**: A verb is a word that expresses an action, occurrence, or state of being. Examples: run, eat, sleep.

3. **Adjective**: An adjective is a word that modifies or describes a noun, giving more information about its 
qualities. Examples: beautiful, tall, delicious.

4. **Adverb**: An adverb is a word that modifies or describes a verb, adjective, or other adverb, indicating manner, 
time, place, degree, etc. Examples: quickly, often, here.

5. **Pronoun**: A pronoun is a word used to replace a noun to avoid repetition. Examples: he, she, it, they.

6. **Preposition**: A preposition is a word that shows the relationship between a noun/pronoun and other words 
in a sentence. Examples: in, on, under.

7. **Conjunction**: A conjunction is a word that connects words, phrases, or clauses. Examples: and, but, or.

8. **Interjection**: An interjection is a word or phrase used to express strong feelings or emotions.

These categories help define the structure of a sentence and the relationships between its elements. In most languages, 
sentences are constructed by combining words from these different parts of speech to convey meaning effectively.
